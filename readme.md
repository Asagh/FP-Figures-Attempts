This is my attepmt at creating figures from the family project data by using the code provided within the alex chase tutorial. 

"Plots from PF data.R" is the file with my code adapted from the alex chase tutorial 

The only other files used are the same as the ones provided to us in the family project drive folder:
"taxonomy.txt"
"OTU_table.txt" 
"Microbiome_mapping_14Oct2019.txt" 

Let me know if there are any questions. Thanks
